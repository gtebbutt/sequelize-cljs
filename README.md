# sequelize-cljs
## Deprecated
This started as a quick wrapper to test out using the [Sequelize ORM](http://sequelizejs.com/) in ClojureScript. It worked well enough, but it became clear fairly quickly that wrapping a relational DB in an object model, and then accessing it from a functional language, was somewhat unwieldy for the project at hand. 

The second attempt, based around the [MassiveJS](https://github.com/robconery/massive-js) library, ended up being simpler to write and simpler to use; you can find it [here](https://github.com/gtebbutt/massive-cljs).
